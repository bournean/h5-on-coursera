  <h1>Our Menu</h1> 
  <div id="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><div class="div-decorator"><p class="menuTitle title1">chicken</p><p class="content">Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries discussed in Lecture 23.)</p></div></div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><div class="div-decorator"><p class="menuTitle title2">beef</p><p class="content">Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view.</p></div></div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><div class="div-decorator"><p class="menuTitle title3">sushi</p><p class="content">Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.</p></div></div>
